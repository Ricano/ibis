## About IBIS - Gestão de Atas

IBIS - Gestão de Atas is a meetings manager web app.

It was created as the final project of a Technologies and Information Systems Programming course.

The app allows the class coordinators to book class meetings with the other class teachers. It gathers every teacher feedback regarding each student of that class, so that the class coordinator can automatically print out a minute of that meeting in pdf format.

There are 3 user roles: admin (Administrador), coordinator (Coordenador) and teacher (Formador).

The following Use Cases diagram gives an overview on what each role is able to do within the app. (written in portuguese)

        User: admin@example.com
        Pass: 123456789

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
